# JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

## Description
For this coding assignment, I will be creating an application tailored for employees to generate a random password based on their selected criteria. The application will operate within the browser and incorporate dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all driven by JavaScript code that I will personally develop. Ensuring a seamless user experience, the app will boast a clean and polished interface that responds effectively to various screen sizes. The skills necessary for the successful completion of this assignment will be covered in this week's coursework, providing me with the knowledge and tools needed to excel in this task.

## User Story
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data  
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria  
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security  

## Acceptence Criteria 
GIVEN I need a new, secure password  
WHEN I click the button to generate a password  
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria  
WHEN prompted for password criteria  
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password  
WHEN prompted for the length of the password  
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters  
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password  
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters  
WHEN I answer each prompt  
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected  
WHEN all prompts are answered  
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria  
WHEN the password is generated  
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
