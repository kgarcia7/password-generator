#JavaScript Module 3 Challenge

## User Story
As a coding bootcamp student
I want to meet all the acceptence criteria listed in the class repo for Module 3
So that I can successfully accomplish this week's challenge of creating an application that can be used to generate a random password based on criteria selected.

## Acceptence Criteria
Given the starter code repository provided
When I make changes to the code, the application will generate a password when the button is clicked
Then I am prompted for password criteria including length and character types selections
When I confirm the type of password I want generated and complete all the prompt questions
Then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria and is displayed onto the page
